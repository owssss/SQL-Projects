-- This is from Datacamp and I tackle the challenge of exploring London's travel Network.
-- London, or as the Romans called it "Londonium"! Home to over 8.5 million residents who speak over 300 languages 
-- While the City of London is a little over one square mile (hence its nickname "The Square Mile"), Greater London has grown to encompass 32 boroughs spanning a total area of 606 square miles!

-- In this project, I will work with a slightly modified version of a dataset containing information about public transport journey volume by transport type.
-- The data has been loaded into a Snowflake database called TFL with a single table called JOURNEYS, including the following data:

-- TFL.JOURNEYS
-- Column	Definition	Data type
-- MONTH	Month in number format, e.g., 1 equals January	INTEGER
-- YEAR	Year	INTEGER
-- DAYS	Number of days in the given month	INTEGER
-- REPORT_DATE	Date that the data was reported	DATE
-- JOURNEY_TYPE	Method of transport used	VARCHAR
-- JOURNEYS_MILLIONS	Millions of journeys, measured in decimals	FLOAT

-- QUESTION #1 : most_popular_transport_types

SELECT TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE, SUM(TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEYS_MILLIONS) TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS 
FROM TFL.JOURNEYS
   GROUP BY TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE
   ORDER BY TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS DESC

-- QUESTION #2:emirates_airline_popularity
SELECT MONTH, YEAR, ROUND(TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEYS_MILLIONS, 2) ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS
FROM TFL.JOURNEYS
  WHERE TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE = 'Emirates Airline'
  AND ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS DESC
  LIMIT 5;

-- QUESTION #3: least_popular_years_tube
SELECT TFL.JOURNEYS.YEAR, TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE, SUM(TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEYS_MILLIONS) AS TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS
FROM TFL.JOURNEYS
  WHERE TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE = 'Underground & DLR'
  GROUP BY TFL.JOURNEYS.YEAR,TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEY_TYPE
  ORDER BY SUM(TFL.JOURNEYS.JOURNEYS_MILLIONS) ASC
  LIMIT 5;
